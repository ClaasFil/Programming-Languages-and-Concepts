# Programming Languages and Concepts - Project Submission

This repository contains the completed assignments for the Programming Languages and Concepts course. Each assignment focuses on distinct programming paradigms and concepts, showcasing solutions and implementations in various languages and methodologies.

## Overview

The project includes the following tasks:

### A1: **Advanced Object-Oriented Programming in Java**
- Developed a property management system for handling apartments, integrating principles of abstraction and polymorphism.
- Implemented:
  - Abstract and concrete classes for apartments (owned and rented).
  - Data persistence using Java serialization and a DAO pattern.
  - Business logic and a command-line interface to manage apartment data.

### A2: **Using Multithreading in Java Applications**
- Created traffic controllers for managing single-lane bridge traffic.
- Implemented:
  - `TrafficControllerSimple` using synchronized methods and wait/notify.
  - `TrafficControllerFair` using explicit locks and conditions for fairness.
  - A simulation system demonstrating the behavior under concurrent threads.

### A3: **Rust Fundamentals**
- Built a Rust application to generate and save Mandelbrot set images.
- Features:
  - Generation of images in PPM format with configurable dimensions and iteration limits.
  - Efficient handling of complex number computations using Rust's traits and types.
  - Use of structs for image and pixel data representation.

### A4: **Basic Implementation of a Compiler**
- Extended an interpreter `BigCalc` to support programs with multiple statements.
- Implemented:
  - Support for assignment and expression statements using ANTLR for parsing.
  - Handling of variables and program execution.
  - Integration of Java's `BigDecimal` for arbitrary-precision calculations.
